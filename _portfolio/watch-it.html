watchIt is a Smartwatch built entirely from scratch, using an ARM based micro-controller and has multiple sensors and modules to do more than the average Smartwatch at the present time can.
For instance, it can be used to control Home Appliances via the ESP8266 Module and gets all it's data in real time.
The OS, and Hardware for this watch was built from scratch.
