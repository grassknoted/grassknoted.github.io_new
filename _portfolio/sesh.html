sesh is a simple (read basic), elegant shell written in Go. It supports the following:
- Aliasing
- Piping and I/O redirection
- Arrow keys up and down for history
- Tab autocompletion

Apart from this, it has two custom builtins:
- walk: walks through the directory specified as an argument recursively. Takes the current directory as input if no argument is specified.
- show: lists the commands in the PATH having the given argument as its prefix. Lists all the commands in the PATH if no argument is specified.
