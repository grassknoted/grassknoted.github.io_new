A simple front end compiler for converting basic constructs of the Rust programming language (if, if-else, for, while, loop) to a form of intermediate code (quadruples). It also supports generation of an abstract syntax tree (AST). The code generated has three kinds of optimizations - constant folding, constant propagation, and loop unrolling
