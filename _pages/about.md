I’m extremely passionate about Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence! I’m currently working on Cognitive AI as a Research Scholar at the Serre Lab at Brown University, and live in Providence, Rhode Island.

I like to work on projects that are impact-oriented and solve real-world problems. My interests are interdisciplinary, blending concepts from Artificial Intelligence, Computer Vision, and Biology.

Today, over 400 million people globally don’t have access to a hospital within a 100km radius, reinforcing the need for affordable and accessible health care solutions using technology and AI. I’m particularly interested in projects that solve problems in medicine and global healthcare.

If you have an exciting opportunity that you think I would be a great fit for, please contact me; I’d love to chat!

<h2>Outside the Lab</h2>
I’m an avid reader (whenever I get time to read), and I’m a huge sports fan. I really enjoy watching Formula 1 and football.
